Analyze the selected code for performance optimizations.

## Performance Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**
   - What's the current Big-O complexity?
   - Can it be improved?

2. **Space Complexity**
   - Memory usage
   - Unnecessary allocations

3. **Hot Paths**
   - Identify expensive operations
   - Loops that could be optimized
   - Redundant calculations

4. **Algorithmic Improvements**
   - Better data structures?
   - More efficient algorithms?

5. **Language-Specific Optimizations**
   - Idiomatic patterns
   - Built-in functions that are faster

6. **Caching Opportunities**
   - Repeated calculations
   - Memoization candidates

For each optimization:
- **Current Performance**: Explain the bottleneck
- **Proposed Fix**: Show optimized code
- **Impact**: Estimated performance gain
- **Trade-offs**: What you're trading (complexity, memory, etc.)

Prioritize by impact.
